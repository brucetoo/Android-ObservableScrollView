# Thank you for your contribution!

Any contributions will be greatly appreciated.

Before submitting a new issue, please check the following guideline.

## Describe your issue as much as possible

The library itself only provides the scroll information,
and creating awesome scrolling effects depends deeply on how you use it: layout, offset calculation to animate views, etc.

Therefore, if you find an issue, please describe not only the issue itself but also the following information:

### If you find it in the sample app of this project

* Required
    * Activity name
    * Operation to produce the issue
    * Modified code
        * If you modified some codes in the sample, it should be described with modified codes
* Preferred
    * Version (git commit hash) of the codes
    * Android OS version
    * device
        * Nexus5, x86 emulator, etc.

### If you find it in your app

* Required
    * Operation to produce the issue
    * Related code
        * Without the related codes, I can't say anything.  
          Screenshot / movie is useful to understand the issue,
          but not enough to discuss the cause of the issue.
* Preferred
    * Version of the library
    * Android OS version
    * device
        * Nexus5, x86 emulator, etc.
